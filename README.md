### A simple webpage styled using vanilla CSS and vanilla JS

<br>

This simple single-page website implements semantic HTML and its elements mainly utilizes flexbox in order to arrange them. 
This project also implements smooth scrolling feature (after clicking an internal link) using JavaScript.
There are no external libraries used in order to implement any of these (pure vanilla).
